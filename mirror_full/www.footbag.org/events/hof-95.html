This is a Sole Purpose Footbag Club of Portland update on the Heart of 
Footbag Freestyle Tournament on Sat/Sun February 18, 19, 1995.  The 
events will be Women's &amp; Open Singles and Team Freestyle and Mixed 
Doubles Freestyle.  Entry fee is $40.00.  I am working with the American 
Heart Association to raise corporate sponsors (the prize money goal is 
$1,500).  

The the freestyle competition will be directed by Kenny.  The plan is to 
judge the subjective portion of the freestyle routines while they are 
performed, and the objective part of the routine by video review with 
the competitor(s).  

Sole Purpose Members would be happy to provide sleeping accommodations 
(really, I can vouch for them).  The Riverside Inn is the host hotel and 
has rooms w/two double beds for a flat rate of $60.00.  Call me to set 
up lodging (503) 236-0939.

We are raising per kick pledges from corporate and individual sponsors 
for Kenny and Tricia's world record breaking attempts in <a href="http://market.net/footbag/article-2.html" target="_blank">5-minute timed 
consecutives</a>.  Considering how much this sport makes your heart pound I 
think the American Heart Association is an appropriate side kick.  
Tricia and Constance have decided it is way past time to raise the ante
for the women's doubles consecutive record (21,025 set on 7/31/86).  
Their doubles record attempt will happen Sun. 2/19/95 morning.

Hope to kick with you all soon.  Kendall KIC
