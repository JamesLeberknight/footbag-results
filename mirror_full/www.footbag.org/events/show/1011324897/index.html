<br><h2>Manually Entered Results</h2>
<pre class="eventsPre">
Hey, everyone, Kaiser here. Sorry it took me so long to post the results for 
this event. Relocating to a new area does take up a lot of time (which I am 
in the middle of doing now)... 
Unfortunately, the PennStateTrio will be somewhat dissolved after this month, 
since Integer has also previously relocated and I am about to do so. But we'll 
always be shredding together at future events. These guys have definitely given 
me some of the most hardcore shred sessions of my life. My personal thanks goes 
out to the PennStateTrio for a few great years of drunken fun and shred. Go East 
Coast! 
So here's the story; These are the final results of probably the PST's last 
event. It was a great one, with LOTS of players and a lot more spectators than 
we could have imagined. We didn't expect too many spectators because the event 
was held inside a hotel ballroom. However, many spectators for the event came 
by, as well as just simply people staying at the hotel who were curious about 
what all of the fuss was downstairs.
The surface was great (thin carpeting), and the players all rocked. Team 
Montreal proved that they were the smooth ones with their mesmerizing shred. Ken 
Somolinos rocked the house with LONG guiltless strings (it seemed that every 
time Ken got the bag, he went for at least 20 contacts and often times way more 
than that), Jon Schnieder bent his legs in ways that made people want to puke 
and cover their children's eyes (swirling spinning set!!!) and PST's own "Flash" 
Gordon held down the fort and handed out a few spankings of his own. Many 
players new to the overall scene were also present, and as we predicted, they 
made a huge splash at this event. Other established intermediates like Brad 
Nelson, Jake Milofsky, and Caleb Abraham will be integral to the East Coast 
footbag scene's future. They will be extremely sick one day very soon... It 
seems that Rob Riefer has gotten a lot better at his game (very little bails, 
and lots of guiltless play). I guess shredding with Kenny Shults can do that to 
you. I was very impressed by the OSU crew. They definitely let us know that 
there is a growing footbag force out in Ohio. And of course, NYFA came and 
reminded us all why we have so much fun shredding and just hanging out after the 
events. You guys are the best, don't ever stop being you. (I recommend to anyone 
that comes to an East Coast tournament that they should make all efforts to hang 
out with the NYFA crew because they are probably the most fun people to hang out 
with at any event).
Special thanks goes out to Jeremy Shinoda, Rob Riefer, Megan Riefer, Bob Green, 
Sebastian "The Hurricane" Duchene, Jake Milofsky, Peter Harris, and Bruce Dole 
for helping us run the event through judging, time keeping, and music 
coordination. You guys are the best, thank you for your selfless efforts in 
making this event what it was. It wouldn't have gone as well if you guys hadn't 
been there to help. Extra special props go out to Scott Bevier (Flash) for 
destroying his bank account to throw this event for the players, and to Alex 
Faber (Integer) who was supportive in numerous ways and was with us in spirit.
All right, I'll stop babbling. Here it is:

(Only top three for each category/skill level are listed because I am lazy and 
pressed for time at the moment)


Intermediate Shred:

1. Caleb Abraham
2. Brad Nelson

<div class="eventsWelcome">
This will be the second freestyle event held by the PennStateTrio (PST, 
minus 
an Integer). However, this time, there will be competition and prize 
money 
involved. This tournament is also a vessel to help accommodate Yacine 
Merzouk's freestyle footbag tour of the U.S.A. This event is guaranteed 
(through lots o' running around and reserving of space) to be ten times 
better 
than last year's P.S.T.O.F.F. event.
We have actually reserved a ballroom for the event to take place in 
(that's 
right, a ballroom! Not a gym, not a conference room, but an actual 
ballroom 
with thin carpeting!; Ideal for shred!) There will be a lot of insane 
freestyle and some crazier freestylers involved. So far, we have a good 
list 
of players attending, and that list is growing fast. Among some of the 
confirmed names are (in no particular order) "The Enforcer" Kenny 
Shults, 
Yacine "The Fiend" Merzouk, Jonathan "The Outsider" Schneider, 
"Flash" Gordon 
Bevier (obviously), Peter "The Executioner" Irish, Sebastian "The 
Hurricane" Duchene, and Ken Somolinos. A few other larger than 
life names are expected to make this list. If you plan on attending the 
event, 
please e-mail: Soze@footbag.org. Newbie or not, let us know if you will 
make 
it. Then check back to this posting the week before the event for a full 
rundown of players expected. You are encouraged to bring any 
friends/spectators along with you. So, clear your calendars for 
P.S.T.O.F.F. 2 
(March 2nd-3rd), sharpen your blades, and get ready to witness the 
sickness.

Hotel Info:


Now, here's the cool part. The event site (the ballroom) is within the 
hotel 
that the players will be staying at. Just a walk downstairs from your 
rooms 
will lead you to freestyler's paradise. Just a walk upstairs after you 
shred 
will lead yo' stinky butt into the shower. 

Host hotel will be the "Days Inn Penn State," 
Located on 240 South Pugh Street, State College, PA 16801
Phone: (814) 238-8454
Call the hotel and mention that you are involved with the footbag 
tournament 
that will be taking place there on March 2-3. You will receive the reduced 
rate of $73.00 per night (you should only need to stay one night at the 
hotel 
for this event anyways, so this is a very good rate, especially if you share 
the room with other players). YOU MUST CALL THE HOTEL BEFORE 
FERUARY 17th IN 
ORDER TO RECEIVE THESE RATES!!! Free parking too!
Note: Flash and Soze have an EXTREMELY limited amount of crash 
space, so you 
must contact them (preferably via e-mail) if you want their extra special 
rates and free complimentary chocolate on your pillow.

If anyone has any problems with the hotel arrangements, then please 
contact 
Flash or Soze via e-mail and we'll try to help. (If you want to find people 
to 
room with, please address and coordinate with the rest of the freestyle 
community via discussion on footbag.org. We aintno dating service and 
cannot 
take the time to match groups and players up according to their 
astrological 
signs and Laver preference).


Driving Directions to the Days Inn Penn State:
(print these out and put them in your pocket before you head out of the 
door!)


From I-80:
- Follow I-80 to exit 24 (Belfonte). 
- At the end of the exit ramp, take Route 26 South. You will follow this 
road 
  for 10-20 minutes and then you will notice that Rt. 26 will also become     
  College Avenue. At this point you will have entered into or are close to 
the 
  downtown State College area. 
- Stay on Rt. 26 (College Avenue) until you reach Pugh Street. Make a left    
  turn onto Pugh Street.
- Go straight through the first light (unless if it is red).
- Within a few yards on the next block, the Days Inn Penn State will be to    
  your right side. 
- Ask front desk to show you where the ballroom is (where the footbag 
event   
  is being held).

From I-81:
- Follow I-81 to exit 23. 
- Exit 23 will offer the option of either taking Route 322 East or Route 
322  
  West. Take Route 322 West. 
- You will be on Rt. 322 West for about a total of 2 hours. There are 
several 
  splits in Rt. 322 that lead to other routes. Be careful in making sure that 
  you stay on Rt. 322 West. 
- After about 80 miles on Rt 322, there will be a split in Rt. 322 that will  
  give you the option of staying on Rt 322 or the option of getting onto Rt.  
  322 Business. Get onto Rt. 322 Business. 
- You will follow this road for about 5-10 minutes. At this point, Rt. 322   
  Business will have become Atherton Street. This means that you have 
arrived 
  in State College. 
- Stay on Rt. 322 Business (Atherton Street) until you come to the     
  intersection of Atherton Street and Beaver Avenue. 
- Make a right onto Beaver Avenue and stay in the right lane until after a    
  few blocks, you'll reach Pugh Street.
- Make a right onto Pugh Street.
- Within a few yards, the Days Inn Penn State will be to your right side. 
- Ask front desk to show you where the ballroom is (where the footbag 
event   
  is being held).

Mandatory Player's Fee For All Players ($3.00-$5.00 per day)


Considering all of the people confirmed that are bringing friends, this 
event 
should be hosting about 40+ players. Due to this overwhelming 
response, the 
PST did not feel that the space that we had previously reserved (a large 
ballroom) would be enough space for a large number of attendees 
such as this 
to shred in comfortably. After all, we must think of space in terms of 
expanded freestyle circles and not just a line of players. Therefore, we 
have 
made accommodations to have another ballroom added to this event.
Don't worry, there won't be two separated ballrooms for the event. The
two ballrooms are right next to each other, and the wall between them is
removable to make one gigantic ballroom with enough space for 
everyone
to shred in. We have reserved the ballroom for Saturday, March 2nd, and
we will attempt to do so again for Sunday, March 3rd if almost every
single person returns for the second day of the event.
Due to the urgent need for this extra space, we have exceeded our
budgets, and we must ask that everyone pays at least $3.00-$5.00 
when
they come to the event (most likely only $3.00, but it may be $4 or $5
depending on final costs). If we find that we will need the ballroom
addition again on Sunday, then we may again ask that a fee of
$3.00-$5.00 dollars (depending on number of attendees for Sunday) be
paid again on the second day. This fee is most definitely NOT for any of
our personal profit, but simply to cover the extra costs that we have
incurred as a result of the overwhelming response for the P.S.T.O.F.F. 2
event.
When you arrive at the event, make sure to come straight to the
registration/judging table and have your registration forms and fees
ready (only if you are competing), and please have your $3.00 players
fee ready before you get set to play. Remember to look at the schedule
again at the event posting on www.footbag.org . The event will start at
1:00pm, but competition should begin around 2:30pm.


Okay, we hope to see you there. Please make sure to drive safely so we 
can 
kick with you when you get here. Peace out.</pre>
