<pre class="eventsPre">
Hey everyone.  The 18th annual Funtastik Summer Classic is now history 
and a wonderful memory.  The 19th annual is already in the planning 
stages.  We were really lucky to only have a 1.5 hour rain delay on 
Saturday.  The weathermen called for showers and rain on Sunday and 
Monday, but it didn’t happen where we were.  HURRAY!!  There was great 
competition, many fun pickup games, shred circles, four square, a world 
record of 1.4 in Super Man by Greg Nelson and a dropless amateur 
freestyle routine by Nate Linscott in the final round. Pete Irish went dropless 
in the pro final round up until his last trick.  The skills contests proved to be 
quite entertaining for the crowd and quite competitive for those entered.  
And oh those d*** golf shots.  Better practice them for next year.  Thanks to 
the service poaching celebrity judges, Brenda Solonoski, Lon Irish, Sam 
Conlin, Carol Wedemeyer and Val Davidson for their expertise. Thanks to 
the superman gladiators, Manu and Yves.  I heard a rumor that Kenny 
Shults won a four square game.  Can anyone confirm that?  Dillon, Joe 
says you were the best music man he has ever had at a Summer Classic to 
date.  You have the job for next year so tell Daryl and Sunny to make their 
plans accordingly.  A novice freestyler, Vinny Iachini, was our youngest 
competitor at 9 years old.

We hosted a Hall of Fame (HOF) Ceremony on Sunday evening at the 
Appalachian Brewing Co.  It was a great setting for the event.  Peter Irish 
was a great Master of Ceremonies.  Thank you Peter.  We would like to 
thank HOF Kenny Shults for his participation and assistance with the 
ceremony.  Thanks to Greg Nelson, HOF Yves Archambault and to all the 
people that came to support and welcome inductees Joe &amp; Brenda 
Solonoski, Jay Moldenhauer, Tim Vozar and Eric Wulff to the HOF.  The 
Beaver Open, who hosted the West Coast HOF, called several times to do 
a combined toast, but had to be put on hold until Jay got through his years.  
Cheering loudly after a countdown, we had toasted the inductees and 
footbag all together around 9:40pm.  

This tournament would not be possible without the great staff and 
sponsors.  Thank you to Vince Bradley, Rob McCloskey, Jack Lentz, Jamie 
Lepley, Garth Smith, Dave Garber, Dan Greer, Myron Selby, Julian 
Solonoski, Kenny Shults, Dylan Johnson, Steve Goldberg and Jennifer 
Selby.  Thank you to all of you who pitched in to move tables, put up signs, 
count adds, etc.  Thank you to our tournament sponsors Funtastik, Jack 
Lentz, World Footbag Association, Freedom Footbags, Harrisburg East 
Holiday Inn, Appalachian Brewing Co., Pro Kicker (Yves Archambault), 
Jamie Lepley, City of Harrisburg Parks &amp; Recreation Department, Kendall 
KIC and Kenny Shults.  Thank you to all the competitors and spectators 
who came to the 18th annual Funtastik Summer Classic.  May you have a 
great year and we hope to see you again next year.
