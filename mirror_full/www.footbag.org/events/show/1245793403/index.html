<pre class="eventsPre">
Thanks so much to all the competitors and spectators who came to the 24th 
annual Funtastik Summer Classic. We appreciate how long some of you have 
traveled to get here, your energy, and your love of Footbag.  We had 33 
competitors and plenty of Footbag friends and spectators throughout the 
weekend. The weather was wonderful, TV Channel 27 did a real nice coverage on 
the event and a good time was had by all.  

Sunday night we honored the 2009 Hall of Fame inductees at the host hotel- 
Holiday Inn.  Master of Ceremonies, Peter Irish, entertained the crowd with 
stunning juggling acts and enlightened everyone with Jane Jones-Zerbe and 
Justin Sexton?s Footbag accomplishments.  Steve Smith was honored by Scott 
Davidson Brenda Solonoski spoke about Carol Weidemeyer. Sunny Freeman Genz 
highlighted events and facts about Daryl before he received his formal 
induction.

Ted Fritsch tested the audience with his Footbag trivia quiz.  Winners were 
handsomely rewarded.  Peter started to wrap up the evening until he was 
reminded that there was one more inductee.  We didn?t really forget Jack, we 
fully intended to punk him!!! Rob McCloskey introduced Jack Lentz and others 
filled in details of his footbag influence. Afterwards, the evening shred 
session and social scene continued for hours.

Monday proved for exciting competition in all venues.  It was "Canada vs USA" 
in the doubles pro match that took several turns and either team could have 
taken the title.  You could see and hear the amazement of many new spectators 
watching the action at the net. The skills contests entertained all. People are 
definitely practicing their golf shots! There were some really amazing shots 
made!

The freestylers put on a great show as usual.  David Clavens performed a 
dropless routine to win top honors.  It is always so entertaining to 
watch festival goers passing by and at some point realize what they are 
seeing.  Their shock, excitement and pure amazement is priceless.  Several of 
the routines have already been uploaded to YouTube.

As most of you know, next year, the 25th annual will be the last Funtastik 
Summer Classic Footbag Tournament.  It will be held on Labor Day weekend in 
Harrisburg, PA and the venues will be the same as usual. The Holiday Inn will 
be the host hotel again and the rooms will be $79 plus tax.  The early entry 
fee is $25 and more events will be added to the Master?s division.  

If you have ever been to a Summer Classic Tournament, please make your plans 
now to come and please spread the word to others.  If you have never been to 
this event, 2010 is your chance to be part of its colorful history!  Hope to 
see you!
