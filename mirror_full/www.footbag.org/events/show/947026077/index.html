********************************************************************************
The 2nd Annual Philly Open was again a success this year.  We had strong 
sponsorship, and were able to post total cash prizes of $900!

Nice weather prevailed this year (except for some wind on day two) and we had a 
nice turnout.  With 35 competitors, and at least 20 other players that just 
came for the fun, I am looking forward to holding the event again next year.

I want to thank my girlfriend, Megan Hanna, for being a trooper throughout the 
whole ordeal.  She helped out with every little thing imaginable, and is 
without question one of the greatest people I know.  I could not have done it 
all without her.

Thanks also to Neil Payne, Dan Kramer, Steve Goldberg, and Kaiser Ahmad, for 
running and judging freestyle.  They all did a terrific job and asked for 
nothing in return.  The same goes to Vince Bradley, Ainto, and Garth Smith, for 
running the net events-- I found out that running net is not my forte, so their 
help was necessary and extremely appreciated (Vince.. I promise I'll learn it 
though!).

For everyone involved, one of the nicest surprises of the weekend was getting 
to meet Garret-  a name we'll all soon know.  He made a valiant world record 
attempt at most consecutive kicks, and was a great help in giving me a hand 
with line painting.  We all look forward to his next attempt at Eastcoasts 
coming up April 29-30th.


Finally, thanks to each and every player that made the trip.  This year's 
Philly Open was one of my favorite tournaments for one reason in particular-- 
the hangout factor.  At the Philly Open, all the players made a big effort to 
be together not only during play, but also for dinners and parties too.  This 
is what makes the sport so great-- getting to meet new people, hang out with 
old friends, and learn more about them and about footbag-- so thanks to all of 
you for being super cool.  A side note:  Those of you that came from afar... I 
owe you a trip to your neck of the woods (that means you Montrealers, and folks 
from IL among others)!  
*************************************************************************
We could not have done as well this year without the help of our sponsors.  

Sal's Pizza box ((610) 933-0600) and the Trappe Tavern (www.trappetavern.com) 
did a great job keeping up with all of our food demands, as well as donating to 
tournament costs.  
Bike Sport (www.bikesportbikes.com) helped out for the second straight year by 
donating, among other things, nice water bottles for all of our players.  

Y100 radio (www.y100.com) was again kind enough to come and play us some tunes, 
and donate some prizes.  Having them on site is always a good time, and we hope 
they will return next year.

Trappe Beer and Soda ((610) 489-2070) was nice enough to donate water for our 
players, as well as a cash donation.  

Funtastik Sports, courtesy our friends Brenda and Joe Solonoski were graceful 
enough to send a very nice box of player prizes.  

Again, we cannot thank the Phoenixville YMCA enough for use, once again, of 
their beautiful facility. 

Schuylkill Valley Sports did a great job printing our shirts at cost, and we 
cannot thank Ethan Klein's friend Kevin (Kevin, if you get this, drop me a 
line... I have a shirt for you) for the artwork that he donated for the shirt 
designs (everyone loved the design Kevin!!).  

Sipa Sipa (www.sipasipa.com) stepped up and donated footbags and stickers for 
all the players, and some extras that I was able to give away to interested 
YMCA youths.  

Once again, one of our biggest supporters was Dennis of Rainbow Imports-- his 
Dirtbags and other assorted products were on sale to support tournament costs, 
as well as being used as prizes.  

Also, I cannot say enough about Diana of Full Moon Fashion 
(fullmoonfashion@yahoo.com).  She provided not only a huge canopy tent for our 
vending and registration booth, but also set up her own professional vending 
booth.  Her help through the whole weekend and the level of professionalism she 
added truly makes her a friend of our sport.  

Finally, I want to thank Tedd Huff of the Footbag Hall of Fame for providing 
hall of fame shirts for prizes, and others on sale at discounted prices- - 
they're really sweet shirts (more info, email Tedd at 
FootbagHallofFame@footbag.org).  

And last but certainly not least... Thanks to the WFA.  

Everyone.. You all ROCK!!  Thanks from the bottom of my surgically repaired 
heart!!!!

See you next year :-)

Sincerely, 
Bob Riefer</pre>

<div class="eventsWelcome">
After a good showing last year (about 35 competitors including Eric Wulf, 
Peter Irish, the DC All Stars and Team Net Wrecker) we are hoping to again 
have a good player base. The YMCA is excited about the event, and is hoping 
that we can pull together to provide a footbag demo for YMCA youngsters (and 
oldsters too, I guess!).

Last year we had about $550 in total prize money, a nice players pack, and a 
player party after the first night of play (noone showed however as they were 
all wiped out!).  I hope to improve on those stats with the help of Y100 
Radio for the second year, our generous sponsors, and player participation. 
That's where you all come in!!  Join us and help make this east coast event a 
success!
</div> <!-- eventsWelcome -->
<div class="eventsDetails">
<b>Event Details:</b><br>
<pre class="eventsPre">
First, I am very excited to be able to add "The 2nd Annual" to our Philly 
Open tournament title.  Thanks to everyone that showed up last year!  

Below, please find driving directions, a schedule of events, and a 
registration form.

To the players: Please try to register earlier rather than later.. it really 
helps me plan the whole event.  Thanks :-)
NOTE: PLAYERS PACKS WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR THE FIRST 45 COMPETITORS. TO 
MAKE SURE YOU RECEIVE A PLAYER PACK, SIGN UP AS SOON AS YOU CAN.  MORE THAN 
45 PLAYERS MAY COMPETE, BUT AFTER THE CUT OFF, THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE PLAYERS 
PACKS. 

To potential sponsors: If I have not contacted you yet, and you are 
interested in being involved in this event, please contact me.

One more thing-- this year's event is officially sanctioned.

OK, here we go...

For players arriving saturday morning, late registration will be at the 
competition site (the Phoenixville YMCA).  Follow these directions to get to 
the site..
1)Follow the above directions up and thru line number 5 (the 
Collegeville/Phoenixville exit)
2)Follow the sign towards Phoenixville (this is rte 29 south).
3)You want to keep following signs for rte 29 south.  This road takes a 
couple of turns, so keep your eyes open. Make sure you keep on rte 29 S!
4)Rte 29 south will shortly bring you to a stop light intersection with 
"Pothouse Road"  (There will also be a sign directing players in the right 
direction here)
5)Go left onto Pothouse road
6)The YMCA is about a 1/4 mile up on your right..You'll see the action!

Tourney hotel: The Hampton Inn &amp; Suites, Oaks PA.  I have reserved a block of 
rooms under my name (Bob Riefer) at a discount rate of $89 per room per 
night.  Each room sleeps 4, and are available in either smoking or non-
smoking.  This is not the same hotel that was used last year, and is much 
closer to the tournament site-- about 6 miles away.  To make a reservation, 
call: 610-676-0900.  NOTE: RESERVATIONS AT THE DISCOUNTED PRICE ARE ONLY 
ASSURED UP UNTIL MARCH 10TH.  AFTER THAT, YOU MAY NOT GET THE DISCOUNT.  To 
get to the hotel, you will follow the above directions onto route 422 west, 
and get off at the "Oaks" exit.  The hotel staff will give you directions 
when you call for reservations, from there (you really can't miss it though-- 
it's visible from route 422).  


Schedule of events:

Friday March 24th: My house.
-2:00-????- Early registration, shred, net, player party.

Saturday March 25th: Tourney site.
-8:00-10:00am- Late registration, pool formulation. (please be on time-- late 
arrivals, especially net players, will screw up the seeding) 
-10:00-5:00pm- Singles net prelims (all).
-4:00-6:00pm- Freestyle prelims (all).
-6:30-9:00pm- Dinner at host bar (directions in player pack).
-9:00-????- Party at my place (about two blocks from the host bar).

Sunday March 26th: Tourney site.
-9:00-12:00pm- Doubles net prelims (all).
-12:00-2:00pm- Freestyle finals (all).
-2:00-5:00pm- Net finals (all).
-5:00-????- Wrap up and awards ceremony.  Dinner nearby?

NOTE: The YMCA has asked us to give a formal demo to the local members 
from 12-2 on both saturday and sunday.  To make things work logistically with 
the competition schedule, I will need freestyle volunteers from 12-2 on the 
25th, and net volunteers from 12-2 on the 26th.  I need your help to make 
this demo work, so please let me know if you're willing to chip in--it will 
be very low key and relaxed, so worry not!


Registration form: Please fill out ASAP and mail to me at the address listed 
above.
