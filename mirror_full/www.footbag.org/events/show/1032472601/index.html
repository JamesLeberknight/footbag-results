<b>Introduction</b>
The Chilly Philly is now in its third year.  Borrowing from the 
tradition of the long beloved East Must jams, we gather each year around 
New Year's day to start the year off right - that is, we start out the New 
Year like we ended the last...  Shredding!

The Chilly Philly has been fairly informal in past years, and will again be 
in 
this format this year.  However, backing for freestyle in the Phildelphia 
area has grown leaps and bounds in the past year and a half.  We have 
more young players, more and better veteran players.  We're surrounded 
by states filled with motivated players willing to travel, and the community 
as a whole is more open to supporting our sport than ever before.

That said, we're going to make this year's Chilly Philly a little more fun 
for 
the players.  Our venue is the Adam's Mark Hotel, 
and it is spacious and well lit with great traction...  This venue also is 
2 miles from one of the hippest main street areas in Philadelphia 
and is readily accessible by train or car or plane.  There will be player 
packsthis year for an extremely modest price (includes a Chilly Philly 
long sleave T with original artwork by a local artist), and we'll also be 
trying to get as many players together for a player's party after the fact 
(players under 21 will need to have a parent or guardian present). 

Last year we had over 50 players in attendance, including some 
of the most dominant players in the game.  We're shooting to demolish 
that record this year.  Only you can help us do that.  Mark your calendar, 
start making your plans, practice.


<b>Hotel information</b> 
The Adam's Mark Hotel
4000 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131 
Phone: (215) 581-5000

Price is $99 per night for up to 4 people in a room.  This is a *very* 
nice hotel with pool, restaurant, bar etc.  Mention the Chilly Philly or 
Philly 
Footworks to get the discount rate.

<i>People calling after the original cutoff date have been experiencing 
some 
problems with making reservations.. I talked to the Hotel today (12/27/02) 
and have made a "test reservation" by calling the main desk.  You should 
be 
able to call and get your reservation now.  If you have any troubles, our 
sales rep is Tonya Nolin (Tnowlin@adamsmark.com).   Since the original 
cutoff 
date is long past, the new discount rate is $99 per night (this is still a 
nice discount over their normal prices of $150 per night)</i>

<b>Venue Information</b>
The shred spots are in the hotel.  When you come in, go to the front desk 
and ask for directions to our spot.. Spots will be changing slightly based 
on time and day.. All spots are sweet.

<b>Schedule:</b>
Friday night - 8:00 p.m. - Happy New Year Hello.  Stop by my place and 
say hi.  Get your player pack.  Get advice on good places to eat in the 
area etc.  Catch up with friends.  Shred in the freezing cold outside my 
house if you're really antsy.  Check into hotel.

Saturday - 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. - More of the above.. Stop in and say 
hi.  I'll be around all day getting ready for the event and hanging with 
footbag friends and family.

Saturday afternoon/night - 5:00 p.m. - <u>Open level players especially!!
</u>- show up at the venue to warm up for shred 30.  The shred 30 
competition will start PROMPTLY at 5:30.  If you're not here on time, you 
scratch and forfeit your entrance fee.

Saturday afternoon/night - 5:30 p.m. - Shred 30.  Open players first 
followed by intermediates and then novice.  For more on the competition 
format, read below.  ALSO, please note, all players are welcome to attend 
even if you're not competing (this is the most asked question I receive).

Saturday night - 6:15 p.m. - MIDNIGHT!!! -Shred.  This is what we're all 
here for.  Let's shred!!!

Saturday night - After shredding - Late player's dinner/party at the host 
restaurant.  Our main sponsor, The Adam's Mark Hotel, has a bar and an 
Applebee's Restaurant inside.  Help us support this establishment as 
they've truly bent over backwards for our sport.  Catch up with friends.  
Eat.  Drink.  Be Merry.

<i>(Alcohol is served at this establishment.  Players under 21 will 
likely need to have a parent or guardian with them.  Note to parents:  We 
love to have parents involved with our scene so don't be shy...  Come out 
to dinner with us!)</i>

Sunday - 1:30 p.m.- 6:00 p.m. - Shredding at the Hotel

Sunday - 6:00 p.m. - Dinner at Applebee's in the hotel before going our 
separate ways.  Have a safe trip!

<b>Directions</b>
<u>To my place</u>
To get in the general area of my house, mapquest to: philadelphia pa, 
19128 (using the zip code in your search is important).  This will ultimately 
take you to route 76 (shuykill expressway)... 76 is not to be confused with 
the pa turnpike.. if you look on a map, on the western edge of philly, the 
pa turnpike changes from being called 76 to being called 276.. at this 
point, 76 splits south eastward... this is the 76 I'm talking about in the 
following directions.  Anyhow, the following will get you from 76 to my front 
door:

Home Phone: 215-482-4454 
Address = 138 Sumac St (1F), Philadelphia, PA 19128

1) 76 East or West 

2) Exit 340 (Lincoln/Kelly Drive.. If heading east, exit is on LEFT hand 
side of road.. Going west, it's on right).  Note:  there are two exits number 
340 (one is A, the other is B)... make sure you pick the one that says 
Lincoln/Kelly Drive

3) If you were heading east on 76, Get ready to get to the right quickly as 
you come down the exit ramp. 

4) If you were heading west on 76, stay to the right as you come down the 
exit ramp.

5) You want to be in the right lane so that you are heading onto Ridge 
West 

6) Merge onto Ridge/Main (you have no choice but to do this) 

7) Stay in the right lane through the light... This means, you are staying 
on Ridge. 

8) Go around steep bend to right. 

9) At next light, turn right onto Manayunk Ave. 

10) Go a couple blocks. 

11) Left on Sumac 

12) 138 Sumac is our address.  Our house is marked by a the 
intersection of Righter St. and Sumac St.  The Right St. sign is literally on 
the edge of our sidewalk.
appartment 1F (as you look at the house, the right hand side porch door 
closest to road is ours) 

<u>To get to the venue</u>
1) 76 East or West

2) Take the "City Avenue" Exit # 339.

3) Going East, I know that the hotel is visible from the end of the exit 
ramp.  You basically go through one red light and turn left at the next and 
you're there.  Going West, I'm not 100% positive, but the ramp drops you 
off in the around the same place.. Check mapquest.  Check the hote's 
website as well: www.adamsmark.com

<u>Train Directions to my place</u>
If you can make your way to 30th street station, the rest is easy.  More 
info can be found at www.septa.org (please check this site.. they've been 
doing construction at 30th street station.  There's notes on travel 
accomodations for weekend train travellers)

1) Anyhow, from 30th street station, take the R6 Train to Norristown.

2) Get off at the Wissahickon stop.

3) Walk uphill (it's obvious which way is uphill) on Sumac Street.

4) After about 3 blocks, you'll see a street sign for Righter Street.  

5) When you get to this point turn to your right and you're looking at my 
house.

6) 138 Sumac Street, appartment 1F

<u>To the venue by train</u>
Again... 30th street station will get you there.  www.septa.org for more 
info - I'd use the "Plan my trip" feature on this website to customize your 
trip.  Also, the septa workers are really really nice... If you call them, 
they'll 
help you plan your trip.  Their number is 215-580-7852.  Please don't 
email me for help on this unless you really need it (I'll just be checking 
the 
site and calling them anyhow).  Your best bet is probably to take a cheap 
bus ride to the general area and then walk or grab a $2 cab ride the rest 
of the way.


<b>Competition/Demo Format</b>
The host venue would like us to show footbag to their members.  We'd 
like to have a competition portion of the evening.  To kill two birds with 
one stone, we're going to hold our competition as the demo.  Here's how 
it will work.

Open level players are going to compete first so that we show our best 
talent while the most spectators are around to watch.  Open level players 
should arrive at 5:00 p.m. to warm up as the competition will begin 
promptly at 5:30.  After the open players, we'll have the intermediates and 
novice players.  PLEASE READ THE SCORING INFORMATION BELOW IF 
YOU PLAN ON COMPETING.  PLEASE READ PRIOR TO EMAILING ME 
QUESTIONS.

Open players - Shred 30.  30 seconds or two drops.  To provide "real 
time" feedback to the crowd, we are going to release unofficial scores 
after each competitor finishes.  The crowd will not understand "Uniques" 
and scoring adjustments, so we'll count adds as we go and announce 
those scores after each player finishes.  We will be video taping the open 
level players and will perform a complete scoring analysis after the fact to 
determine the true champion.  Same scoring methods as usual... 
Uniques, adds, drops all figure in.  raw add count + (unique tricks &gt;= 3 
adds * add ratio)

Intermediate.  Shred 30.  Most adds in 30 seconds.  We want to 
encourage the intermediate level players to keep the ball off the floor - 
and the best way to win this event is to keep the ball up (drops don't 
count as tricks and they waste time, so they hurt you a lot).  That said, 
we'll NOT be factoring in unique tricks nearly as heavily as for the open 
players.  Only if two players are dead even in scoring will we resort to 
considering uniques.  In other words, intermediate scoring will be based 
solely upon total adds performed in 30 seconds minus a substantial 
deduction for drops.  Your goal as an intermediate in this particular 
competition is to keep the ball up, and do your bread and butter tricks.

Novice.  Trick Builder 30.  This is a new event.  For novice players, we 
want to encourage originality and build your confidence.  Drops will not be 
considered in the scoring unless two players are dead even in the 
results.  Your job as an novice in this particular competition is to show us 
your variety of tricks.  Be creative.  Show us that you know some tricks on 
both sides of your body.  Show us your flyers.  Show us originality and 
style.  Don't worry about stringing tricks together like a pro - you're not a 
pro yet, so just show us what you've been practicing.  Novices will be 
judged at the sole discretion of our qualified judges (people like myself, 
Kenny Shults, Jon Schneider...) based on who we think the most stylish 
up and comer is.

<b>Prizes</b>
Open level.  50% or more of all competition fees collected will be awarded 
as cash to the winner of the Shred 30 competition.  Winner takes all.  2nd 
place on down just win bragging rights.

Novice and Intermediates.  We'll have some product prizes for the first 
and second places in each of these categories.

<b> Fees </b>
Each player will owe a $4 venue fee.  An extra $5 will be collected if you 
plan on competing.  

<b>Other Notes</b>
Every player will need to sign (or have their parent or guardian sign if 
you're under 18) a waiver.  The waiver is standard and basically removes 
liability from the event organizer (me) and from the venue.  

All collected fees will be directly used to pay event costs.  Philly 
Footworks will not profit in any way from this event.

<b>Waiver notes</b>
Competition fee is only owed by those that are competing.  Of course you 
can still come if you're not competing.  Every player owes the $4 venue 
fee. CASH ONLY IF YOU PAY AT THE EVENT
