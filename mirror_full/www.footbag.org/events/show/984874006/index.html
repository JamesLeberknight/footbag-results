Yeah freestylers!

This was a weekend to be remembered.  The Penn State Trio has just
concluded its first footbag gathering, and I think it went off fairly
well. 

The early session on Friday evening with a small contingent of the NYFA
crew was the bomb!  Saturday morning was another story though. . .Penn
State University wasn't any help to us whatsoever in organizing this
event.  I tried my hardest to work around their system, but they managed
to screw us at the last moment.  Our original spot to play at on Saturday
and Sunday was listed as unused, but when we rolled in at 12:30 Saturday
morning, there was a gathering of all of the high school marching band
drum-lines in the world (small exaggeration, but there were a ton of
them).  I know for a fact that virtually every other location on campus
suitable for all of us to kick at was reserved, but Kaiser Ahmad pulled
off a Herculean effort and found us a spot.  

Kaiser gets the Super-Propz award for the weekend in my opinion.  He took
a lot of flak at first for the surface, but I know it was the best we
could find.  At any rate, the freestyle on Saturday was pretty sickly.  I
believe there may be another post of some of the stuff hit.  It was
apparent that everybody's been schooling.  The players from Mechanicsburg
(Edwin, Pat, and Kirk) are some serious up and comers. . .I've never seen
fairy sets like this, and their freestyle showed some nice flow.  Rob
Riefer and Kenny Shults must be schooling a bunch because I saw Rob hit
ripwalk &gt; ducking legover &gt; smear on a dare.  Kenny. . .well. . .he was
Kenny.  Apparently I missed the first appearance of spyro-gyro from him in
6 years, and I saw a run that included two helpings of whirr, another with
blurriest &gt; down double &gt; down diver, and some more with gyro barrage
(although they were bails. . .he was going for gyro barroque).  Ken
Somolinos introduced food processor to the Penn State freestyle scene, as
well as superfly and a zillion other bad-ass moves that don't get hit
here.  I guess the Penn State Trio needs to be schooling a bit harder
<grin>.  

Saturday evening deserves some mention.  Aintno gets many thanks for his
help this weekend; I coulnd't have had dinner and a party at my place
without him.  Pat McNiese, one of the Mechanicsburg shredders, also gets a
round of applause for his cullinary abilities.  He basically kicked
everyone off of the equipment in my kitchen and went to work on the
spaghetti dinner.  It was a bit unorthodox in the method of serving (you
all know what I mean), but I though it was damned good.  

The freestyle on Sunday morning is second-hand to me (I've seen Scott
Bevier's tape of the session; I was still asleep).  Scott busted
atomic double legover in a session at the HUB, and get this:  Ken
Somolinos hit flurry &gt; smog &gt; smog.  Damn that dude is nasty.  There was
another session later on during the day, but I had to jet to work.  I'll
be Kaiser or Ken would be happy to send in some highlights of that time.  

I'm sure I haven't mentioned about a million of the rough-neck shreds that
went on, so I'm inviting everyone in attendance to submit their
favorites.  As for the turnout, the real thanks should go to all of the
players that came to support the Penn State Trio in their first official
footbag forum.  There were a bunch of circles ranging from novice to pro,
and I think we may have influenced most players to push their game
to a new level.  That's what it's about, right?  

I had a lot of fun this weekend.  I hope everyone else did too.  Thanks
for coming out, and I hope to see you all at East Coast Championships.  

        Integer, Soze, and Great Scott


P.S.  So if everyone had a good time, we might be persuaded to have
P.S.T. OFF 2 this summer.  I'll keep my channels open.  </grin></pre>

Just like the name of the event implies, you better be here for it, or else! 
(you'll miss some phat shred) We have some VERY awesome freestylers and 
some dope net players already confirmed for attendance, so bring your lavers 
and shorts, and be ready to have your shred on point. You will be there, we 
have spoken!

<b>Event Details:</b><br>
<pre class="eventsPre">
No Hotel Info.; All players should be accommodated with crash space-

If any players wish to arrive on Friday night (March 30), then you must 
contact one of us and let us know before that weekend. We will provide you 
with separate directions to one of our apartments.
If any players wish to stay for the entire weekend, it is IMPERATIVE that you 
contact one of us before that weekend so we can make sure to have enough crash 
space available for you.

The Plan:

Friday: 
(This is only for players that wish to arrive on Friday night) If you wish to 
arrive on Friday night so that you can setup before the Saturday shred, then 
you are more than welcome to come down. There will be no freestyle or net on 
Friday, unless if someone tempts us to shred.

Saturday:
If the weather should seem to be ideal for outdoor freestyle, then we will 
shred out in front of the Old Main Building on the University Park Campus of 
Penn State University starting at 1:00pm. However, if the weather should seem 
to disfavor the possibility of outdoor freestyle, then we will meet in the Rec 
Hall Building located on the University Park Campus of the Penn State 
University starting at 1:00pm. We will be behind the bleachers of the North 
Gym. (The bleachers may be closed up, so look for them regardless of whether 
or not they are open or closed up) Net play will be available if net players 
are willing to play outdoors regardless of weather conditions. Net players 
must make an effort to bring their own net sets. (We have none)
Afterwards, we will either chill out and do whatever people feel like doing, 
or we may attend a party for all of the players. (Big players party is not 
definite, it is still in the works. However, if you send a flood of emails to 
Scott or Alex, they might have to oblige)  

Sunday: 
More footbag as soon as everyone recovers from the day/night before.

Directions:
Obviously, you will need directions to meet up with us. However, many of the 
sites that we have designated for freestyle will be on the University Park 
Campus. Therefore, as soon as you arrive to the campus, you will need a campus 
map to find the areas where we will be playing. You can get this map by going 
to www.psu.edu. When you are at this page, scroll down towards the bottom of 
the page and look for a link that reads "Student Information". Under that link 
there will be several sublinks. Click on the sublink that reads "Visitor 
Maps..." When you arrive at this page, use the provided options to download a 
map of the University Park Campus. You will need the Adobe Acrobat Plugin to 
view these maps. A link for a free, easy, and quick download of the Adobe 
Acrobat Plugin will be available on this page. We STRONGLY suggest that you 
download the map with the numbered buildings. We also STRONGLY suggest that 
you print out this map and the corresponding building numbers on the next page 
and remember to bring it with you.

&gt;From I-80:
- Follow I-80 to exit 24 (Belfonte). 
- At the end of the exit ramp, take Route 26 South. You will follow this road 
  for 10-20 minutes and then you will notice that Rt. 26 will also become     
  College Avenue. At this point you will have entered into or are close to the 
  downtown State College area. 
- Stay on Rt. 26 (College Avenue). 
- You will come to the intersection of Rt. 26 (College Avenue) and Burrowes   
  Street. Make a right onto Burrowes Street. This will lead you onto the     
  University Park Campus. 
-*You will arrive at an intersection that has a four way stop sign. (Remember 
  to stop) This will be the intersection of Burrowes Street and Pollock Road. 
- Make a left onto Pollock Rd. 
- A few feet ahead of you, you will notice a parking lot to your right side.  
  Pull into this lot and park there. 
- At this point you should have your campus map out of you pocket. Check out  
  the weather, and determine where you think we will be. Follow the map to one 
  of the designated playing areas that was mentioned in the schedule for     
  Saturday. Either area will be a short walk from that parking lot. Look for  
  us pulling off Big Apple Sauce to Shooting Torque.
- (If there are no spaces available at the parking lot, then take a short 
  drive around campus and find another parking lot. There are a ton of parking 
  lots all around campus. Just make sure that you read the sign at the 
  start of each parking lot and make sure that the sign indicates that weekend 
  parking is allowable in that lot)

&gt;From I-81:
- Follow I-81 to exit 23. 
- Exit 23 will offer the option of either taking Route 322 East or Route 322  
  West. Take Route 322 West. 
- You will be on Rt. 322 West for about a total of 2 hours. There are several 
  splits in Rt. 322 that lead to other routes. Be careful in making sure that 
  you stay on Rt. 322 West. 
- At some point, there will be a split in Rt. 322 that will offer the option 
  of staying on Rt 322 or the option of getting onto Rt. 322 Business. Get 
  onto Rt. 322 Business. 
- You will follow this road for about 5-10 minutes. At this point, Rt. 322   
  Business will have become Atherton Street. This means that you have arrived 
  in State College. 
- Stay on Rt. 322 Business (Atherton Street)until you come to the     
  intersection of Atherton Street and Beaver Avenue. 
- Make a right onto Beaver Avenue. 
- Quickly get into the left lane and go down one block where you will come    
  upon the intersection of Beaver Avenue and Burrowes Street. 
- Make a left onto Burrowes Street and go straight. 
- Follow the rest of the steps that are provided in the directions for     
  I-80 above.*

If anyone needs additional directions from another area or needs any other 
information, please don't hesitate to contact us and ask for some help. We're 
nice people..., really!

Okay, we hope to see you there. Please make sure to drive safely so we can 
kick with you when you get here. Peace out.</pre>
