-----------------UPDATE!!!-------------------

A Few announcements:

The GOOD NEWS    -We have secured the venue and gained use of on of the large 
gyms with rubber floor for excellent traction when shredding.  We have this 
for both days
                 -Another good piece of news, I have eliminated any fees for 
Competition Entry.  If you have some skills, now it costs nothing extra to 
give it a try.  
                 -More good news, the shirts that can be purchased at the 
event have been drastically reduced in price from around ten dollars per 
shirt to just Six Dollars ($6.00 per shirt).  They are really cool and a 
great shirt to wear for kicking or going out in.  This is cost for me, so the 
price is as low as possible.

The Bad News:

The Price for admission has just been raised by our Venue, the NAC, to $15.00 
per person per day.  This is a great Venue with a large area for lots of 
shredding, over 11 (Eleven) Hours Worth of Shredding all told, water 
fountains that are easily accessible, and other accomidations within close 
proximity to the Gymnasium including restrooms and Vending machines and a 
snack bar.  The music will be great, we have pros and legends alike comming, 
and it should make for a kick ass weekend.

_______________________________________________________
 
      I need anyone who plans on attending 
to email me soon and let me know, even if you're not sure if you can 
make it. If you plan on staying in the hotel and want it for the special 
price, you need to call and get a room a month before October 17th, call by 
the 15th 
of September to be safe.  
      There won't be preregistration.  When you get to the NAC, our venue, 
you will pay $15.00; just tell them you are there for "Footbag".
      I need anyone that wants a shirt to email me with their name and shirt 
size.  These will be the only people gauranteed to get a shirt.  Everyone 
else may get a shirt who wants one, but I can't proise I'll have you're size, 
Im getting a few more larges, it seems to be the most common size.    
Please email me ASAP if you plan on getting a shirt. 

______________________________________________________

*I'm trying to make this as cheap as possible.  OK, keep reading.

-   This event will take place from 6:00pm-11:00 pm friday night, 
and there will be more of the same the next morning on Saturday, from  
10:00am-4:00pm.

-   Prizes For Competitions:

OPEN LEVEL:  Due to recent changes, there will be no cash prizes, simply 
props from all and bragging rights.  

NOVICE &amp; INTERMEDIATE.  We'll have some product prizes for the first 
and second places in each of these categories.

-   We will be filming a lot of the Jam and the competitions, and we hope to 
make a video edited by myself and some friends to either sell to those 
who attend, maybe make this a prize as well, and to put some of the event 
on www.philly-footworks.com

-   As far as entry fees for competitions are concerned:  
    There are none, it wil be free to enter in order to keep costs down

-   Where to Crash for the Night:
        
Hotel:  Hampton Inn &amp; Suites        Phone #:  215-860-1700
           1000 Stony Hill Road,        Web:  www.hampton-inn.com/hi/newtown
           Yardley, PA 19067

~The "Footbag" Rooms that are being blocked off are $99.00 a room, 
that is $20.00 off the normal price, I'm trying to talk them to a cheaper 
price, but either way, Fit as many people as you can in each room, and it 
won't be too expensive.  Really nice place, right off of the I95 
Newtown/Yardley Exit, and it is on the same road basically, the Newtown 
Bypass, as is the NAC, our venue.

~We are also trying to get any locals to have people crash at their 
homes, or camp out in yards, but you have to talk to certain people.  
Contact me if you have a place for people to crash.

***  Email me if you plan to attend. The Philly Footworks Crew 
will be there, I'm talking to some people in New York and Jersey.  The 
D.C. All-Stars are all invited, as well as as anyone who kicks.  I am really 
trying to promote the sport, and hopefully get some new players involved, 
including those that aren't aware that it is a semi-organized sport.  Bring 
your friends, family, whatever.  We hope to have some legends come, but 
I have to talk to some of them first.  Anyone with some ideas for me or 
suggestions for ANYTHING at all, just let me know.  This is my first time 
runnning a Compettition and Jam, but I have some great people helping 
me at Philly Footworks.  Again, don't miss this, it should be a blast!!!
