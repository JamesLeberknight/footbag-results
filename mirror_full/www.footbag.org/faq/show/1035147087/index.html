<h1 class="faqQuestion">OLD: What are the general policies for posting to the announcements list?</h1>
<p></p>
<br/><div style="font-size: 10pt; border:2px solid #2f2f4f; padding:1em; overflow:auto;"><b>Please Note:</b> This section is out of date. We no longer host a mailing list discussion board. Everything is now part of the <a href="../../../forum-down.html">Forum</a> and you can read the rules for posting to the forum at <a href="../../../forum/viewtopic.php">http://www.footbag.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12</a>.
</div><br/><br/>
<font style="font-size: 8pt;">
If you read this information and understand it, you're likely to have no problems getting your posts to go through. But of course, this FAQ entry can't account for every possible situation, so use your best judgment.
<p>
Below are the top 11 list policies on footbag.org. Scroll down to see each one described in detail:

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">No advertisements</a>
<li><a href="#2">Use only plain text (no HTML or rich-text messages)</a>
<li><a href="#3">Get used to rejection</a>
<li><a href="#4">Think before you post</a>
<li><a href="#5">Use your real, full name in the return address</a>
<li><a href="#6">Read up before posting</a>
<li><a href="#7">Don't be lazy</a>
<li><a href="#8">Give context for follow-up messages</a>
<li><a href="#9">Stick to one thread at a time</a>
<li><a href="#10">Keep your e-mail address up to date</a>
<li><a href="#11">Post to list addresses only when necessary</a>
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
<hr/>
<p>
<a name="1">(1) No advertisements:</a>
<p>
Don't even think of blatantly advertising for products or services 
for your own personal gain, or for that of anyone else. It's fine to 
edify and inform people of products, rate them and discuss them, 
etc., but it becomes a problem if it turns into a formal endorsement 
or advertisement. I run this service (with lots of help), under the 
auspices of a non-profit corporation, and with resources that cost me 
over $150 a month at the current rate. I will not have the list turn 
into a marketplace. I will not be responsible for transactions that 
go bad as a result of a member of my website or this e-mail list 
entering into any financial interaction with any other player or 
member.
<p>
Repetitive, "subliminal" ads are NOT okay. Please just be *honest* 
and if a discussion comes up that involves your website or your 
products or services, feel free to discuss it openly. But do not 
annoy list members with constant mentions of your favorite websites 
or companies.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="2">(2) No HTML mail ("rich text" in Hotmail, default in AOL 6.0, Outlook):</a>
<p>
Please (PLEASE) don't use HTML mail (ever). Turn it off immediately, 
once and for all.
<p>
HTML mail is stupid in general, but especially problematic for the 
footbag discussion lists. HTML was not designed to be used for 
e-mail, and many e-mail programs do not handle it correctly.
<p>
More importantly, fully half of our members are on the digest version 
of the list, which puts all mail in-line into a huge message every 
day and mails it to them, and HTML mail simply doesn't work (it looks 
like garbage to non-computer geeks). I personally hate the digest and 
am thinking about killing it because of all the problems it causes. 
But since we still have so many people using it, please respect them 
and only post *plain text*. Otherwise, the digest will be completely 
illegible.
<p>
If you post HTML, the moderator may ignore you, but usually will 
reply with a BOUNCE message to tell you to fix it. But you have to 
figure out how. The moderator can't spend the time to teach everyone 
how to use e-mail.
<p>
You people on AOL 6.0, please call AOL and complain and/or ask them 
how to disable HTML for your outgoing mail.
<p>
Hotmail users need to always make sure the "rich text format" 
checkbox on your "compose" screen is *UNCHECKED*. (Mac users on 
Hotmail don't have to worry. It does the right thing.) Never send 
mail to the list in "rich text".
<p>
Plain text means e-mail with absolutely no mark-up -- no bold-facing, 
no underlining, no font changes, nothing. Just plain, simple, text.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="3">(3) Rejection:</a>
<p>
Expect your post to be rejected if you haven't read the policies here 
and are not adhering to them.
<p>
If you are rejected (with a "BOUNCE" message), DO NOT argue with the 
moderator. Try to understand the issue, and feel free to offer a 
compromise, but do *NOT* argue. It serves no purpose but to create 
animosity. The moderator is simply trying to help keep the 
conversation on topic and within the expectations of the bulk of the 
list's membership, to keep this forum as efficient and informational 
as possible. This is not a free-for-all.
<p>
When the moderator rejects a posting it is *not* personal, and you 
should not treat it that way nor should you make it that way by 
arguing with the moderator.
<p>
We no longer guarantee to write e-mails explaining the reasons for 
rejecting posts. It just becomes too much of a burden to get into a 
discussion with every person. If your message is not suitable for the 
list, it simply won't show up. For newer members, we'll still give 
some feedback to help you understand the guidelines because they are 
not all clearly documented.
<p>
For you regulars who keep getting bounced, and you know who you are, 
sorry but if your message doesn't show up and you see other messages 
showing up with a send date after yours, that means it was rejected.
<p>
If you don't like this new policy or any of the policies we're going 
to begin enforcing, we urge you to go start your own list.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="4">(4) Thinking:</a>
<p>
Please don't reply willy-nilly to posts on the list. Think it out, 
decide whether or not you want to post the message to the entire list 
or just to a person you're talking to. And then, carefully consider 
whether your message will be rejected. It wastes the moderator's time 
and yours if you post a message that will be rejected. And you know 
who you are, those of you who have the same types of posts rejected 
over and over again, so please cool it.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="5">(5) Signatures and From lines:</a>
<p>
Use your real full name (first and last) in the From: line of your 
outgoing e-mail (you must configure this in your mail preferences). 
Use proper capitalization in your name. (E.g., if your name is John 
Smith, put John Smith in your name setting on your e-mail program; do 
*not* put "john smith".)
<p>
ONLY users of AOL will be allowed to leave their names off the From: 
header because many AOL users can't set this up. But all AOL users 
*must* put their full name in the signature. Not just first name. 
Both names. No exceptions. With proper capitalization. ("Proper 
capitalization" does NOT mean ALL-CAPS. It means *proper* 
capitalization. Everyone should have learned this in second grade. If 
you are not old enough to have gone to second grade, you are not 
allowed to post to the list.)
<p>
Again, to be clear, messages like this:
<p>
<pre>
     From: "Sarah Chen" 
     To: footbag@list.footbag.org
     Subject: Re: [footbag] Why Hacky Sack is the worst footbag manufacturer
</pre>
*will* be accepted, whereas messages like this:
<pre>
     From: "A goofy hacker" 
     To: footbag@list.footbag.org
     Cc: marshall@yahoo.com, bill@excite.com, fred@poly.edu
     Subject: what he said
</pre>
will *NEVER* be accepted. :-)

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="6">(6) Read up before posting:</a>
<p>
Do not post any messages to the list until you're *completely* caught 
up! That means, before you post a single message, read *all* the mail 
on the list that has arrived since you last read mail. Then, reply to 
the thread(s) you have replies for, and in some cases take the 
opportunity to reply to multiple messages on the *same thread* in the 
*same message*. Don't rapid-fire 6 messages on the same thread the 
same night, replying to everyone else's posts. That's just a pain for 
everyone. But be warned if you post a single reply to multiple 
different threads (see 9 below), you will be rejected.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="7">(7) Don't be lazy:</a>
<p>
<dl>
<dd>a. Replying -- Don't include the entire message you're replying to 
in your post. Cut it down to just the bit you're actually referring 
to, to give folks context (in fact, this is requested, see 9 below).<br/>
<br/>
<dd>b. Posting -- Don't post questions that you can easily find the 
answer to yourself. Don't ask me or anyone else either, before you 
check the website. The best thing to do before you begin posting is 
to read *everything* at http://www.footbag.org/faq (F.A.Q. stands for 
"frequently-asked questions"), as well as on the freestyle section at 
http://www.footbag.org/freestyle -- and of course the footbag.org 
website is the repository for most of the information people 
frequently want relating to footbag. For example, don't post "what 
kind of shoe do people use?" or "what kind of footbag do people 
use?", and especially not "what kind of music do people listen to 
when they play?" The first two are easily answered by reading the 
information online; the third is just plain annoying.
</dd></dd></dl>
<p><hr/><p>
<a name="8">(8) Give context for follow-up messages:</a>
<p>
Similarly, don't reply without giving context! Always use the same 
subject line as the thing to which you're replying, and include a 
snippet of the specific point to which you're replying (and not the 
whole message, please). Use the *REPLY* function of your mail 
program, which will help you. Don't manually type Subject: lines 
because you'll probably get it wrong. For the threading feature of 
many people's mail readers to work properly, the subject lines have 
to be exactly right. Otherwise, if you randomly change the subject 
line every time you post, nobody can keep track of the conversation. 
Especially not a year from now when they're perusing the archives. 
(Has everyone seen the archives? It helps a lot to do that to get 
some idea why this matters. http://list.footbag.org/ )

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="9">(9) Stick to one thread at a time:</a>
<p>
Don't combine two threads into one. Keep them separate so people can 
follow the various conversations (see 8 above). Use your reply 
button/command to reply to messages on the list, so that the Subject: 
header is correctly reformatted to keep threads together as described 
above.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="10">(10) Keep your e-mail address up to date:</a>
<p>
Don't post to the list from an e-mail address in the From: line that 
is not subscribed to the list. If you change e-mail addresses, you 
must update your list membership (see http://list.footbag.org/).

<p>There is an exception however. If you join the lists using your @footbag.org
address, we will allow you to post from your private e-mail address as long as it
matches what's in your member profile. So be sure to keep your member profile
up to date.

<p><hr/><p>
<a name="11">(11) Post to list addresses only when necessary:</a>
<p>
Don't write the list itself when you can write a more specific address.
<p>
<dl>
<dd>a. If you want to talk to someone and you can't remember their 
address, don't post to the list saying, "Hey, so-and-so, if you're 
out there, write me." The member directory at 
http://www.footbag.org/members/ is your best source of contact 
information, and/or the list archives which show the e-mail address 
of everyone posting (at http://list.footbag.org/).<br/>
<br/>
<dd>b. If you want to unsubscribe or have an administrative question 
regarding the list, for goodness' sake just ask the administrator 
(me) directly. If people don't know my e-mail address by now, ... 
Also, don't be afraid that Allan or I will bite your head off. Just 
expect it, and it won't hurt so much. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<dd>c. If you are replying to a message, never send your mail without 
looking back over it, seeing if the freestyle list is cc'ed or not, 
and only cc it if you are really sure! Many messages can just go 
privately and don't need to go to the list. Consider using private 
e-mail to follow up public posts, as opposed to completely open 
conversations. (Visualize it this way: every time you post to the 
freestyle list, you're walking up to the podium in a large auditorium 
and seizing the microphone. Vs. just walking over to someone who has 
just spoken over the microphone and continuing a private conversation 
on the sidelines.)
</dd></dd></dd></dl>
<p><hr/><p>

These are not the only rules, but the most important ones. We reserve 
the right to refuse to post messages for any reason. Don't take this 
the wrong way, but if you're not happy with how we moderate this 
discussion group, feel free to create your own.
