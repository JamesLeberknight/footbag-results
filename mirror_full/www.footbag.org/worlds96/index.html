<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Do spectators need to pay to see the event?</h3>
<blockquote>
No.  The World Championships is free to spectators.  All of the preliminary rounds
(except freestyle) will be held in a public park (La Plaine des Jeux).  Anyone can
come check them out.  The freestyle rounds (see <a href="../schedule.html">schedule</a>)
and all finals will be held inside the amusement park (La Ronde) which normally charges
an entry fee.  <b>However</b>, if you are coming specifically to see the World Championships,
you can get a <b>free pass</b> to La Ronde for the entire week -- to get your free pass,
show up at <a href="../schedule.html">late registration</a> (even if you're just a spectator)
or write <a href="mailto:martinco@videotron.ca" target="_blank">Martin Côté</a>.  We have a limited
supply of La Ronde passes, so competitors, staff, and their family get priority, and then it's
first-come, first-served.

</blockquote>
<h3>How far is the hotel from the airport?</h3>
<blockquote>
15-20 minute ride downtown.  Approximately CDN $25 fixed fee.  Not charged by
the number of people in the taxi.  The shuttle bus will drop you in front
of the hotel (if requested) and costs about half the price of a taxi.
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I get from the host hotel to the site?</h3>
<blockquote>
La Plaine des Jeux is a 5 minute walk
from the Ile Ste. Hélène metro (subway) stop.  There is a free shuttle bus
to La Ronde from the Ile Ste. Hélène metro.  After the freestyle events at
La Ronde on Thursday, Friday, Saturday -- the bus returns to a different
metro station which means one line to the hotel (2 blocks away).  Use of
the metro will probably take 45 - 60 minutes maximum in each direction,
but a car is definitely more direct.  By car in non-rush hours will take
20-30 minutes plus you have the cost of parking on the Island ($7/day although
registered competitors and staff receive free parking) and the hotel ($9/day -- we may
have a special arrangement for free parking for guests at the
hotel).  You should be able to find free overnight street parking near the
hotel.  Just remember to remove all items visible to possible thieves. 
Montreal is a very safe city if you use street sense, but we're known as
the car theft capital.
</blockquote>
<h3>How much is Metro fare?</h3>
<blockquote>
CDN $1.75 per ticket -or 6 for $7.75 (1.29 1/6 cents each)
</blockquote>
<h3>What are the hours of public transportation in Montréal and how often do the trains run?</h3>
<blockquote>
During the week until 12:45 a.m. and on weekends until 1:30 a.m.  First
train around 6:30 a.m.  Trains run very frequently.
