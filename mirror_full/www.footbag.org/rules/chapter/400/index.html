<h1>Article IV - Footbag Golf</h1>

<div class="rulebook_comment">
<span class="u">Comment:</span> The first official game of footbag golf was played in Delta Park, Portland, Oregon in August, 1982, and was organized by John Stalberger. The constant challenge, the social nature of the game, and the fact that it's inexpensive to play are attractions. Footbag golf is a recreational sport for everybody, regardless of age, gender or ability.   The object of the golf game is to traverse a course from beginning to end in the fewest number of kicks of the footbag. Each kick is made from where the footbag came to rest after the last kick.   Footbag golf is a game that expects high standards of etiquette and courtesy. Among the basic considerations of etiquette are such things as: respect for plant life on the course, and allowing faster groups to play through if asked. Footbag golf can be as challenging as any of the other footbag games, but it is the easiest to learn, because players are not required to link consecutive kicks.

<h2><a class="rulebook_section_header_color" name="401">401. Conduct of Players</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>401.01. Courtesy<a name="401dot1"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="401dot1dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">General</span></span>: Players should take care not to produce any distracting noises or any potential visual distractions for other players who are kicking. Examples of discourteous actions are: yelling, freestyling, slapping course equipment, kicking out of turn, throwing or kicking golf bags, and advancing on the fairway beyond the away player. Yelling "Fore" at an appropriate time to warn someone in danger of being struck by a footbag is not a violation of courtesy. Interpretation of courtesy also includes other actions as expected by the rules, such as: refusal to assist in the search for a lost footbag, refusal to move equipment, refusal to keep score properly, etc.. Players should not kick until they are certain that the kicked footbag will not distract another player or potentially injure anyone present. Players should watch the other members of their group kick to aid in the locating of errant kicks and to ensure compliance with the rules.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="401dot1dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Smoking</span></span>: Courtesy also dictates that players who smoke should not allow their smoke to disturb other players.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="401dot1dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Penalty</span></span>: A player violating a courtesy rule may be warned by any affected player, even if from another group, or by an official, with all players of the group advised of the warning. A one-kick penalty will be assessed for each subsequent infraction in the same round. Repeated violations of courtesy rules may result in disqualification in accordance with section 404.05.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>401.02. Order of Play<a name="401dot2"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="401dot2dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Tee-off Order</span></span>: Tee-off order on the first tee is determined by the order in which the scorecards were filled out. Tee-off order on all subsequent tees is determined by the score on the previous hole, with the lowest score kicking first, and so on. If the previous hole was a tie, count the score back over previous holes until the tie is resolved.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="401dot2dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Order of Play</span></span>: The player farthest from the hole, (the "away" player), always kicks first. Kicking or putting out of order is a courtesy violation, and may be called by any player in the group.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="401dot2dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Practice Kicks</span></span>: If a player takes a practice kick or an extra kick with any footbag at any time after the start of a round and prior to finishing the last hole of the round, a one-kick penalty is incurred. A hand toss or hand roll of a footbag or other object for the purpose of testing course conditions is considered a practice shot and a one-kick penalty will be incurred. The infraction must be observed by any two players or an official.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>D</b>. <a name="401dot2dotD"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Player Responsibility</span></span>: It is the responsibility of the player to play the course correctly. If a player kicks from the correct tee, and either misplays a mandatory dog-leg or kicks toward an incorrect target, and the mistake is discovered at any time prior to the player's scorecard being turned in for the round, the player may not re-tee and must proceed to play the hole correctly. If the player in this case has already kicked into a target, his lie must be marked on the ground within one meter (3 feet) of that target with no relief. If a player kicks from an incorrect teeing area, and the mistake is discovered prior to the player's scorecard being turned in, the player must re-tee correctly and the incorrect kicks will be added to his score as practice kicks. In any case of the course being played incorrectly, if the mistake has not been corrected at the time that the player's scorecard is turned in for that round, the player shall retroactively incur a six-kick penalty.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>E</b>. <a name="401dot2dotE"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Playing Through</span></span>: During tournament play, no group may play through the group ahead unless the group ahead is required to stand aside in accordance with the rules (see rule 403.09 and 404.03-C).
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>401.03. Excessive Time<a name="401dot3"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="401dot3dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Limit</span></span>: A maximum of 30 seconds is allowed to each player to make a kick after:
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>1</b>. the previous player has kicked;
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>2</b>. the player has taken reasonable time to arrive at the footbag and place a marker;
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>3</b>. the playing area is clear and free of distractions.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="401dot3dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Infractions</span></span>: On the first infraction per round, the player is warned by any two players of the group or an official. A one-kick penalty will be assessed for each subsequent infraction in the same round if observed by two or more players of the group or an official.

</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>403.01. Legal Kicks<a name="403dot1"> </a></h3>
All kicks must begin with a hand toss such that the footbag is in the air prior to the kick. The footbag must be completely separated from the hand and shoe prior to contact and must be struck prior to contact with the ground.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>403.02. Teeing Off<a name="403dot2"> </a></h3>
Play will begin on each hole by the player kicking from the teeing area. All kicks must be started with a hand toss. The player's supporting point closest to the hole at the time of the kick must be placed within a six-foot-square tee box. Teeing off improperly constitutes a stance violation, and will be handled in accordance with section 403.04-C. Once a player has teed off, he must complete the hole.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>403.03. Marking the Lie<a name="403dot3"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="403dot3dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">General</span></span>: After the tee-off, the kicked footbag must be left where it came to rest until a legal marker is placed on the ground between the hole and the footbag, touching the kicked footbag. (See Sections 403.04 and 403.05 on placing the marker when the kicked footbag is not playable.) The marker may not be moved until the kick is completed.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="403dot3dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Violations</span></span>: A warning will be given by two or more players in the group, or by an official, for the first violation of this section during a round. A one-kick penalty will be assessed for each subsequent violation if observed by two or more players of the group or an official.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="403dot3dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Breakage</span></span>: If a kicked footbag should break and come to rest in more than one piece, the lie of the largest piece will be taken as the result of the kick.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>403.04. Stance<a name="403dot4"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="403dot4dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">General</span></span>: During a kick while on the fairway, one of the player's supporting points (or foot) must be placed within 12 behind the lie marker and on the imaginary line running from the hole through the center of the marker. This is illustrated in Fig. 6. When the footbag is kicked, no supporting point contact may be made with the marker or any other object closer to the hole than the rear edge of the marker. Stepping past the marker is permitted after the footbag is kicked, except when putting within the marked area of the green surrounding the hole.

Allowed footbag placement during a drive. The foot must contact an imaginary line extending 12 inches behind the footbag on a line drawn from the hole (or nearest "mandatory") through the lie of the footbag. NOTE: for on-green putting, the 12-inch line does not exist, and the foot must be placed ON the lie, but not past it.

<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="403dot4dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Putting</span></span>: Any kick from within the marked area of the green is considered a putt. During a kick on the green, the support foot must be placed directly on the lie of the footbag. A follow-through after a putt that causes the kicker to make any supporting-point contact closer to the hole than the rear edge of the marker constitutes a falling putt and is not allowed. The player must demonstrate full control of balance before advancing toward the hole. See also 403.12.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="403dot4dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Violations</span></span>: To be valid, a stance violation must be called within three seconds after the infraction. The call must be made by another member of the group, besides the kicker, or by an official. When the call is made by a player, it must subsequently be confirmed by at least one other player in the group, not excluding the kicker. A player will receive a warning for the first violation of a stance rule in the round. Subsequent violations of any type of stance rule in the same round will incur a one-kick penalty. All stance violations must be re-kicked prior to subsequent play by other members of the group. Stance violations occurring outside the greens area must be re-kicked from the original lie. Unsuccessful putts within the marked area of the green will be re-kicked from where the footbag comes to rest after the stance violation occurred.

<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>403.05. Relief<a name="403dot5"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="403dot5dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">General</span></span>: Obstacles to a player's stance or kicking motion that are permanent, or integral parts of the course cannot be moved or bent or in any way altered by the player to facilitate the kick, except as to allow the player to take a legal stance on the lie. When playing the lie, the player must choose a stance that will result in the least movement of any part of the obstacle between the lie and the hole.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="403dot5dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Non-permanent Obstacles</span></span>: Relief may be obtained from non-permanent obstacles to a player's stance or kicking motion. Non-permanent obstacles are things such as: casual water or mud, loose leaves, broken branches no longer connected to a tree, other player's equipment, moveable trash cans, motor vehicles, harmful insects or animals, and spectators who prevent safe play. In situations where the permanent or fixed nature of an obstacle is unclear, it will be determined by an official. Prior to the start of a round, the tournament director may designate non-permanent areas from which relief may be obtained.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="403dot5dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Procedure</span></span>: To obtain relief, the player must first attempt to remove the obstacle.
