<h1>Article III - Footbag Net</h1>
<div class="rulebook_section">
</div>
<div class="rulebook_comment">
<span class="u">Comment:</span> Footbag net is a court game played either one-on-one or two-on-two (singles or doubles) over a 5 ft. net. It combines basic kicks, serves, spikes and digs. Each player or team attempts to score points while serving. In singles play, two kicks are allowed per side. In doubles play, three kicks are allowed per side and players (teammates) must alternate contacts. The court is 20 ft. wide and a total of 44 ft. in length, with the net dividing the court into two 22 ft. deep courts. The court is also divided down the center to form four equal serving quadrants.

<h2><a class="rulebook_section_header_color" name="301">301. Interpretation</a></h2>
The purpose of the following rules is to provide guidelines to best describe how footbag net is played. Since its inception, footbag net has relied on good sportsmanship and fair play by all players. Therefore, the players have a basic responsibility to play within the regulations set forth and to have mutual respect for all opponents and fellow players. Violations of the player's basic responsibilities may result in penalties and disqualification by the tournament director.

</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>302.01. Court Dimensions<a name="302dot1"> </a></h3>
The footbag net court dimensions are the same for both singles and doubles play. The court dimensions are 20 feet in width divided in half by the center line and 44 feet in length divided in half by the net, making four equal serving quadrants. For each side, the right hand serving quadrant will be considered the "even" side, and the  left hand serving quadrant will be considered the "odd" side.

<h3>Figure 2 - Net Court Dimensions</h3><img align="top" src="../../../rules2/html/figure-2.png"/>
</div>
</dd></dl>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>302.02. Net Height and Stanchion Placement<a name="302dot2"> </a></h3>
The net height is five feet and is measured at center court. Net stanchions should be as close as possible, but just outside the net court boundaries; net stanchions are out of bounds. (A net mesh of one inch is recommended so that the footbag may not pass through.)
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>302.03. Court Surface<a name="302dot3"> </a></h3>
The footbag net court may consist of or have any type surface. Well-trimmed grass is suggested. The surface must be essentially flat and free of holes and obstructions. A player's safety must be a determining factor when laying courts. Use of gym floor tape and/or existing court lines is recommended for laying indoor courts.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>302.04. Boundary Lines<a name="302dot4"> </a></h3>
The boundary lines surrounding the court are part of the court and are played in-bounds. If the footbag touches any part of the line, the shot is played as a good shot. In the absence of line judges, if a player (team) cannot see the footbag out, the shot must be called in.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>302.05. Footbag Net Equipment<a name="302dot5"> </a></h3>
Touching any part of the net equipment such as the net, stanchion and guy wires constitutes a foul, unless the bag is driven into the net with such force that the footbag's trajectory causes the net to contact a player on the other side (See Foul Definitions, 303.09-C).
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>302.06. Line Width<a name="302dot6"> </a></h3>
All official line widths shall be two inches (2").

</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="303dot1dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Choice of Footbag</span></span>: Prior to the start of play, players (teams) shall decide which footbag will be used in the game (match). In case of disagreement, tournament officials will provide a footbag.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="303dot1dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Footbag Dimensions</span></span>: Footbags used in regulation footbag net play must fall within specifications set forth in Article 1, Section 107.01-D.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="303dot1dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Coin Toss</span></span>: A coin toss shall be used before the first game to determine service or side. When possible, the head judge or scorekeeper shall be responsible for tossing the coin. The player/team with the highest seed going into the match shall call the first toss. If a tie-breaker game is required (i.e., the third game in rally or classic scoring), the team losing the coin toss of the first game shall call the coin toss for the third game. The winning player/team of a coin toss may choose exactly one of the following options before the start of that game:
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>1</b>. Service: The player/team winning the coin toss may choose whether to serve or receive first. If this is the first game of the match, the opposing player/team may thus choose which side of the court they will occupy for the game ("side").
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>2</b>. Side: The player/team winning the coin toss may choose which side of the court they will occupy for the game. If this is the first game of the match, the opposing player/team may thus choose whether to serve or receive first ("service").
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>3</b>. Defer: The player/team winning the coin toss may forego their right to choose service or side, and may instead defer to their opponent(s) to make that choice (in which case the player/team losing the coin toss shall be treated as the winner of the coin toss for the options above).
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>D</b>. <a name="303dot1dotD"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Ready for Service</span></span>: Each person shall be in a ready position preparing for play by either standing in the proper receiving quadrant or standing behind the service line. Server must wait until receiver is ready.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>E</b>. <a name="303dot1dotE"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Changing Sides</span></span>: Players/teams are required to change sides of the court, according to the type of scoring system used. See 303.04-H Changing Sides for a detailed description of conditions for changing sides with each of the scoring systems.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>303.02. General<a name="303dot2"> </a></h3>
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="303dot2dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Live Footbag</span></span>: The footbag is considered "live" beginning with the moment of contact by the server's foot, and is considered "dead" as soon as the footbag touches the ground, net stanchions, anything beyond the court perimeter, drops below the net without going over it after a player or team has used the maximum allowable number of kicks, or a foul occurs, whichever comes first. Note: A Net Equipment Foul supersedes all other fouls, and may occur after the footbag would otherwise be declared dead (see 303.09-C), unless a net plane foul (see 303.09-D) causes a net equipment foul, in which case the contact foul supersedes the net equipment foul, or unless the footbag is driven into the net with such force that the footbag's trajectory causes the net to contact a player on the other side of the net.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="303dot2dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Legal Kicks</span></span>: A kick is legal when the footbag is contacted with one continuous striking motion by a legal kicking surface. This includes double hits, rolls, and pushes, as long as a striking motion is used and the delay, double hit, or roll is clearly accidental.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="303dot2dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Player Classification</span></span>: No player will be allowed to move down in division in the same tournament (using singles net as the standard). For instance, after playing singles footbag net in an intermediate division, a player may not play doubles footbag net in a novice division.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>1</b>. Players will not be allowed to substitute for any reason once their first match of the tournament is in progress.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>2</b>. The use of arms to screen a shot is not allowed. Screening the serve, in any way, is not allowed.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>3</b>. Uniforms are encouraged for all competitors in net events.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>303.03. Scoring Systems<a name="303dot3"> </a></h3>
There are three approved scoring systems for footbag net.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="303dot3dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Classic Scoring</span></span>: With classic scoring, points are only awarded when the serving team wins a rally. A rally is the sequence of playing actions from the moment the service is hit by the server until the footbag is ruled "dead". The serve (but no point) is awarded to a receiving team who wins a rally, also referred to as a "side out".
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="303dot3dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Rally Scoring</span></span>: In rally scoring, a point is awarded to the winner of each rally, regardless of who serves. The serve and a point are awarded to a receiving team who wins a rally.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="303dot3dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Game-Set-Match (GSM) Scoring</span></span>: GSM is a scoring system similar to tennis, wherein games are played to four points, and six games make up a "set". The winner is then determined by a "match" that is the best of 3 sets.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>D</b>. <a name="303dot3dotD"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Determination of Scoring System</span></span>: 
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>1</b>. Selection: The tournament director may choose any of the above three official scoring systems for any of the events offered at the tournament. Different events may use different scoring systems -- e.g., intermediate singles net could use GSM where open doubles uses rally scoring. However, this is strongly discouraged, as it can lead to confusion and inconsistency.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>2</b>. Player Notification: Players must be notified of the scoring system to be used at least 24 hours before the start of competition, and again at the players' meeting and/or before each round of competition.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>3</b>. Consistency: The scoring system for a given event must not change between rounds of the event. In other words, if rally scoring is used in the qualification round, it must also be used for quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. It is never appropriate to change scoring systems within a single event.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_element">
<h3>303.04. Service<a name="303dot4"> </a></h3>
Each server has one chance to get a good serve into the proper receiving court (novice classification may be allowed two serve attempts). The serve is made from behind the service line of either the right-hand or left-hand court (see Service Rotation). If the serve hits the net, but still falls over the net and into the proper receiving court (a let serve), the server will be allowed a second serve. A let serve on the second attempt causes a side out.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>A</b>. <a name="303dot4dotA"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Hand Toss</span></span>: The server must drop or toss the footbag into the air before kicking it over the net.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>B</b>. <a name="303dot4dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Service Rotation</span></span>: Players/teams serve from the left- or right-hand court to start each rally in a game based on the scoring system being used (see 303.03 Scoring Systems), as detailed below:
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>1</b>. Classic Scoring: When the serving person's or team's score is zero or even, service is made from the right-hand court; when the serving person's or team's score is odd, service is made from the left-hand court. Service must go diagonally ("cross-court"), e.g., from server's left to receiver's left, or from the server's right to receiver's right. In doubles, the serving team must switch sides of the court as necessary for the server to be on the correct side. Receiving teams do not switch sides.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>2</b>. Rally Scoring: Service rotation is the same as with classic scoring, above, except that at the end of the first game in a match, the losing player or team of the first game shall decide which player or team shall serve first in the second game.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>3</b>. GSM Scoring: When serving in a standard game, the server shall stand behind alternate halves of the court, starting from the right-hand court in every game. In a tie-break game, the service shall be served from behind alternate sides of the court, with the first service from the right-hand court. In both game types the second serve continues from the left side of the court.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">
<b>C</b>. <a name="303dot4dotC"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Server Rotation</span></span>: Service rotates between the players/teams in a game according to scoring system being used (see 303.03 Scoring Systems), as detailed below:
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>1</b>. Classic Scoring: In singles, at the end of each standard game, the receiver shall become the server and the server shall become the receiver for the next game. In doubles play, for each game of a match, the first team to serve chooses which player will begin service. After the first team makes their choice, the receiving team will choose who will receive the first serve. The player on the receiving team who does not receive the first serve will be the player who serves first after the first side out. For each subsequent side out of the game, service will rotate to each player in turn. In the second game of a multi-game match, the losing player or team serves first. A coin toss determines which team serves first in a third game. When no scorekeeper is present and a team has served out of order, the team loses the serve and any points gained during the out of service foul. All players resume correct positions on the court.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>2</b>. Rally Scoring: In doubles play, for each game of a match, the first team to serve chooses which player will begin service. After the first team makes their choice, the receiving team will choose who will receive the first serve. The player on the receiving team who does not receive the first serve will be the player who serves first after the first side out. For each subsequent side out of the game, service will rotate to each player in turn. In the second game of a multi-game match, the losing player or team has the choice to serve or receive first. A coin toss determines which team serves first in a third game.

<div class="rulebook_item">

      <b>3</b>. GSM Scoring: In singles, at the end of each standard game, the receiver shall become the server and the server shall become the receiver for the next game. In doubles, the team due to serve in the first game of each set shall decide which player shall serve for that game. Similarly, before the second game starts, their opponents shall decide which player shall serve for that game. The partner of the player who served in the first game shall serve in the third game and the partner of the player who served in the second game shall serve in the fourth game. This rotation shall continue until the end of the set.
</div>
<div class="rulebook_item">

            a) Receiving Order (Doubles Only): The team due to receive in the first game of a set shall decide which player will receive the first serve in the game. Similarly, before the second game starts, the other team shall decide which player will receive the first serve of that game. The player who was the receiver's partner for the first serve of the game shall receive the second point, and this rotation shall continue until the end of the game and the set.

<p>A player's "year-end ranking" will be calculated from points received in all tournaments held after the previous year's World Championships and through that year's World Championships. For example, a 2003 rank begins with tournaments held in 2002 (starting after the 2002 World Footbag Championships) and ends with the 2003 World Footbag Championships.</p>

A player's "current ranking" is calculated by summing points received at (1) all tournamnets within the past year including those for the event that is currently being seeded, (2) two-thirds of points earned at the World Footbag Championships held two years prior, and (3) one-third of points earned at the World Footbag Championships held three years prior.

If the losers' bracket finalist wins the match, then the two players or teams are tied and another match is played to determine the winner of the event.

<b>B</b>. <a name="304dot2dotB"> </a><span class="b"><span class="u">Game Length</span></span>: In a double elimination format, the winners' bracket is normally played with matches being the best 2 out of 3 games to 11 points. However, the final four matches in an event (finals, finals of the winners' bracket, and the last two matches in the losers' bracket) are played best 2 out of 3 games to 15 points. In the losers' bracket, matches are a single game to 15 points, except for the last two as noted above. This shorter game length expedites the losers' bracket, which has more matches and can take longer to play. The tie-breaking match of the event (in case the losers' bracket finalist wins the first match against the winners' bracket finalist), may also be a single game to 15 points.

They can advance in this bracket until their next loss. The winner of the consolation bracket, however, does not face the winner of the winners' bracket. Instead, they are simply the winner of the consolation bracket.

In a consolation pool/bracket format, the loser(s) of the second or subsequent (usually single-elimination) round go into a consolation bracket to determine relative placement and future seeding of those players. They can advance in this bracket until their next loss. The winner of the consolation bracket, however, does not face the winner of any other bracket. Instead, they are simply the winner of that consolation bracket.
