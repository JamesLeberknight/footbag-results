<h1>Footbag Patterns</h1>
</center>
<hr/>
<p>

The following footbag patterns are available in both PostScript and
GIF formats. <b>If you have any way of dealing with PostScript, click
on the PostScript button next to the pattern you are interested in to
download the file, because the PostScript version is much better.</b>
For example, you can adjust the size of the PostScript version. There
is more information about dealing with PostScript in the <i><a href="../FAQ.html">Footbag Pattern FAQ</a></i>.<p>

The GIF versions have been rendered for a radius of 1.125 inches,
although you probably won't be able to read this on the GIF patterns.
This makes an average sized bag.  If you just want to look at the
patterns, you can see the GIF versions by clicking on the GIF button
next to the pattern.  If you want to print the GIF version, you can
print the GIF directly from your browser. If you have image hacking
software you should use your browser to download the file (usually by
clicking and holding in Netscape, or by using the File menu in Mosaic;
other browsers and platforms will vary).<p>
<em>Note: when you print the patterns, make sure that the 1-inch
vertical and horizontal scale bars are <b>exactly one inch</b> long,
or the pattern will not work.</em> See the <a href="../FAQ.html">caveats</a> about GIF files<p>

Each pattern includes a picture of the finished bag, but you will need
to know how many of each shape to cut out.  This information is
included below, <i>but not on the patterns</i>, so you will need to
note the numbers of the shapes. The name of the pattern prints out on
the pattern, but the name is typically some short name more-or-less
derived from the official name listed below.<p> 

For more information about using the patterns, see the <i><a href="#technotes">Technical Notes on the PostScript Files</a></i> and
<i><a href="#usepattern">How I Use the Patterns</a></i>.  For answers
to questions about the patterns, materials, sewing, washing and other
issues about footbags in general, see the <i><a href="../FAQ.html">Footbag Pattern FAQ</a></i>.<p>

An unusual design. You have to pay attention as you're sewing; use the
picture as a guide.  Strangely, the pattern for the 26-panel bag is
almost exactly the same size. The name on the pattern is "Snub-38."

I haven't made one these, but I imagine it takes a long time. The name
on the pattern is "rhombico."  <i>Note: This is the FIXED VERSION of
this pattern.  An earlier version had a bug that made the pattern too
small.  This one is correct.</i>

<h1><a name="technotes">Technical notes on the PostScript files</a></h1>

These are PostScript(tm) files.  Don't delete the '%!' at the beginning of
the file; some spoolers use this 'magic-cookie' to determine the file
type. <p>

There are a couple of parameters that you might want to adjust in the
files.  First, you can adjust the radius of your finished bag; the
radius is usually computed from the center to one of the vertexes of
the polyhedron, or from the center to the center of an edge.  <p>

I have put in values for the radius that make bags that I think are a
pretty good size, but you will want to adjust to your own liking.  The
radius is specified in inches in a line at the beginning of the file:<p>
<pre>
        /radius 1.13 def
</pre>
<p>
Just edit the number ("1.13" in this case) to be bigger or smaller.
You'd be surprised how a small change (like .05 inches) can radically
alter the weight and size of a bag.<p>

Another thing you might need to change is the font defined for
printing the labels on the patterns.  If your printer doesn't want to
print the patterns, it may not have the Helvetica-Narrow-Bold font.
Just change the font in the file to Helvetica or Times-Roman, ie
change the line<p>
<pre>
        /Helvetica-Narrow-Bold findfont 10 72 div scalefont setfont
</pre>
<p>
to
<p>
<pre>
        /Helvetica findfont 10 72 div scalefont setfont
</pre>
<p>
Finally, there is a parameter to control the width of the flange (more
about that below) that is added to the panels for sewing.  The
parameter (flangewidth) is defined just like the radius, and the
default value is .2 inches:<p>
<pre>
        /flangewidth .2 def
</pre>
<p>
Just change the .2 to be whatever works for you.<p>

I have also included images of the finished footbags, which were
printed out using <a href="../FAQ.html">Kaleidotile</a>, a very cool program.

<h1><a name="usepattern">How I Use the Patterns</a></h1>
<p>
This is rather difficult to explain -- and even more difficult to
justify.  I am very particular about sewing.  <p>

As you will notice, each shape in the pattern is drawn twice, once
with notches and once without.  The templates without notches are
actually oversized --- the corners of the _notches_ are actually the
corners of the finished panels.  Reason for the notches is to allow me
to draw sewing guides on the material, and my seams are sewn from
notch-corner to notch-corner.<p>

First, cut out the patterns roughly and glue-stick them to a stiff
piece of paper -- I use a file folder.  Then cut the pieces more
precisely along the printed lines.  This gives you a fairly durable,
accurate template for drawing on the Facile or whatever you are using
to sew.<p>

I use the following procedure for drawing the pattern on the material.<p>
<ul>
<li>First, using the un-notched template, I draw as many copies as I will need.
<li>Then, I carefully line up the notched template, and I draw in the notches on the previously drawn shapes.
<li>Then, I cut out the pieces, but <b>not</b> the notches --- they are just used as guides for sewing.
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
To sew them together, I use medium-weight polyester thread.  Some
people say this may tend to tear facile, but I have never had a
problem and it's much easier to deal with than the rope most bags are
sewn with.<p>

My sewing proceedure is to line up the the edges of two pieces and
clamp them together with a tiny binder clip (those little black triangular
clips with the flip-down handles).  If you cut out your pieces
carefully, the edges will line up correctly.  If you are sewing a bag
with different shaped pieces, the edges of the pieces won't be the
same length and you have to center the smaller piece on the larger.
The following picture tries to show how this might look for a hexagon
and square being sewn for an 'octacube' -- the '.' indicates the
corner of the notch drawn on each piece, which should line up on both
pieces.   That is, if you stick your needle in the dot on one side, it
should come out the dot on the other.<p>
<pre>
       ________________     ___
      |/              \|     ^
      /                \     | .2 inch
     /|   .        .   |\   _|_
    / |                | \

</pre>
<p>
Using the binder clip makes it easier for me to sew straight from one
dot to the other.<p>

Note that the patterns are drawn such that there is a .2 inch flange
of material outside the seam.  Once I am done with all but the last
one or two seams, I use a good pair of sewing sissors to cut off of
the leftover 'flange' material about 2mm from the seam.<p>

Well, that's about it.<p>
