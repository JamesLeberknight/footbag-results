<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

Footbags come in many shapes, sizes, designs, and materials.  Before you
select a footbag, you should really have some idea what you're going to
do with it.  This page describes the types of footbag most commonly
used for the sport, and gives suggestions as to what to look for.

<a name="freestylebags"><h2>FREESTYLE FOOTBAGS</h2></a>
</center>
<p>
The most common form of footbag, freestyle, involves basic kicking, passing,
and tricks (both kicks and "stalls").  Freestyle players range in ability
from novices (still learning basic kicks to participate in a circle) to
advanced players (doing complex combinations of maneuvers requiring exacting
dexterity and timing, as well as a lot of practice).<p>

Regardless of the level of player, freestyle requires a specific type of
footbag.  In general, the footbag should be <b>soft</b>, <b>durable</b>,
<b>round</b>, and
easy to <b>break in</b>.  (A hard footbag, like the original two-panel
<a href="../mattel.html">Hacky Sack</a>®, is very difficult for freestyle because it is relatively bouncy,
making it frustrating for newer players to control the bag, and making it
virtually impossible for advanced freestylers to "stall".  However,
<a href="../mattel.html">Mattel Sports</a> has since come out with a much more
modern line of footbags.

There are two basic types of freestyle footbags: <b>crocheted</b> footbags and
those made from <b>stitched panels</b>.  The crocheted footbags are good
for beginners because they are almost always a good size, durable, and round.
Unfortunately, many crocheted bags can be hard to break in--but once broken
in, they make for good freestyling.  The most popular brand of crocheted
footbag is the <a href="../sipa-sipa.html">Sipa Sipa</a>® footbag, sold in many
sporting goods stores. The <a href="../sipa-sipa.html">Sipa Sipa</a> ®
footbags are consistent in their manufacture and weight, and very durable,
as compared to other brands of crocheted footbags.<p>

Stitched footbags come in a variety of sizes, and have a varying number of
<b>panels</b>.  The number of panels tends to affect the price, as well as
the material from which they are made.  The best materials are synthetics
that mimick soft leathers, because they break in quickly, are relatively
durable, and can withstand water (in fact, most synthetics are washable).
Generally speaking, the more panels, the rounder the footbag, but the more
expensive.  There are quite a few brands of multi-panel footbags, listed
below.<p>

For beginners, we recommend the <a href="http://adidasfootbag.com/sport-14.html" target="_blank">adidas ® Footbag 14-panel
"sport model"</a>
bag made from a washable, durable, soft synthetic material -- available
in most sporting goods stores that carry <a href="http://adidasfootbag.com/" target="_blank">adidas ®</a> products.  For advanced
freestyle players, we recommend either the <a href="../kitg.html">Twisted (tm)</a> footbag (with a unique
swirling panel design made from a washable synthetic) or the <a href="../clipper.html">Juice (tm)</a>
footbag, a 32-panel (like a soccer-ball) washable synthetic bag.<p>

Most footbags are between 25 and 45 grams, half-way between the size of
a golf ball and a baseball.  Size and weight are very much a matter of
personal preference for freestyle.<p>

<a name="netbags"><h2>NET FOOTBAGS</h2></a>
</center>
<p>
For playing footbag net, the choice of footbag is very important.  In net,
players need to be able to accurately direct the footbag, deliver powerful
shots, and not have the bag "flop" around.  Footbag net players tend to
look for <b>round</b>, <b>firm</b>, and <b>sturdy</b> footbags -- i.e.,
footbags that don't break in too much, hold their shape, and aren't too hard
to kick straight up or over the net.<p>

There are really only a few footbags well-suited to the game of footbag net.
The <a href="../mattel.html">Mattel Sports</a> "<b>Jammer (TM)</b>" was reasonably good for net but is hard
to find nowadays.  However, the newer "<b>Net Juice (TM)</b>", made by <a href="../clipper.html">Flying Clipper Footbags</a>,
is the current bag of choice by most advanced footbag net players.  The Net
Juice is a 32-panel bag (just like the freestyle "Juice"), but made of
<b>vinyl</b> instead of a soft leather substitute.  We highly suggest using
the <a href="../clipper.html">Flying Clipper</a> Net Juice for every level of footbag net play.<p>
