Footbag Results — Canonical Archive (v1.1)

PURPOSE
"This workbook is an archive-quality, canonical record of historical footbag competition results."
"It is intended for long-term preservation, historical research, and statistical analysis."

KEY RULES
— Excel is a presentation layer only. Source of truth is CSV output from the pipeline.
"— Never edit IDs (event_id, person_id, player_id)."
"— Aggregate people ONLY by person_id, never by name."
"— If something looks odd but passes QC, it is a historical fact."
"— Persons_Truth is the only authoritative identity table. All analytics derive identity exclusively from person_id — never by name."
"— Person_Stats reflects only complete/mostly_complete coverage divisions. Any pivot on raw Placements_ByPerson must filter by coverage_flag first."

SHEET GUIDE
Index — master list of all events with hyperlinks to year sheets.
YYYY — one sheet per year; human-readable event records.
Summary — dataset scope and health metrics.
Divisions — all known division names and categories.
Divisions_Normalized — canonical division name mapping.
Division_Stats — division-level participation and wins.
"Person_Stats — per-person career statistics (pivot-ready; coverage-filtered: complete/mostly_complete only)."
PersonStats_ByDivCat — per-person stats broken down by division category.
Placements_ByPerson — competitor-centric placements with coverage flag (read-only).
Persons_Truth — authoritative identity table (read-only); includes career stats and active years.
Analytics_Safe_Surface — pre-filtered pivot source: coverage complete/mostly_complete and identity-locked. Use this as your default analysis base.
Persons_Unresolved — identity punch list; rows needing alias or manual review (read-only).
Placements_Unresolved — excluded/unresolved placements; recovery scope (read-only).
Coverage_ByEventDiv — coverage ratio per event/division.
Data_Integrity — registry of dataset health metrics (placements; persons; coverage).
Players_Clean — historical name tokens after cleaning.

ANALYSIS GUIDANCE
"— Use Person_Stats for medals, careers, and participation (coverage-filtered)."
— Use Division_Stats for discipline growth analysis.
"— Year sheets are for reading, not analysis."
"— Filter Placements_ByPerson by coverage_flag = complete or mostly_complete before aggregating."
"— Use Persons_Unresolved to find unmapped players and excluded persons that may need aliases added."
"— Use Placements_Unresolved to assess the scope of excluded data and identify recovery candidates."
